Most of my experience is in tooling for software engineers. I spent 7 years working on [GoLand, the IDE for Go](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/). 
So I know a thing or two about compiler frontends, static analysis, and the UX of code editors.

- On development of static analysis tools for string-embedded languages ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2855667.2855672), [talk in Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4TKkTKaBE)).
- [Intro to the Go programming language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V5GAYoaKRE) (lecture, in Russian).
- [Inside GoLand: How Go language support works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RkHot9MES0) (meetup talk, in Russian).
- [Supporting Go generics in GoLand](https://soundcloud.com/generictalks/generictalks-s03e03-goland-special) (episode of the Generic Talks podcast, in Russian).

During my (unfinished) PhD, I focused on dependently typed programming languages and theorem provers. 
I also spent a year at the JetBrains Research HoTT group, working on tooling for the [Arend](https://arend-lang.github.io/) theorem prover. So I know a bit about formalized mathematics and can formalize a theorem or two.

- [Programming Language Foundations in Arend](https://github.com/marat-rkh/PLFArend) - the PLFA book re-written in Arend (Part 1). [Mentioned](https://plfa.github.io/#derived-works) on the original PLFA website.
- [Formalization](https://github.com/marat-rkh/van-kampen) of Van Kampen's theorem in Arend (partial).
- [Intro to the View pattern](https://habr.com/ru/companies/JetBrains-education/articles/277989/) for custom pattern-matching rules in dependently typed languages (blog post, in Russian).
